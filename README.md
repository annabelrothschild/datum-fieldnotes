Datum Fieldnotes is a powerful data documentation tool designed to enhance your data management and analysis process. Write notes, review your changes in the log, and better understand your data collection and documentation process. The tool tracks and documents the changes made in a sheet by the user during a session, and allows users to add notes to these changes as well as automatically document said changes in a log sheet. The ability to access these features will help data workers learn to understand their data transformations and track their progress, as well as provide the needed context to pass along to the next worker or data scientist.

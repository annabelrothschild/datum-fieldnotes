Datum Fieldnotes is a powerful data documentation tool designed to enhance your data management and analysis process. By writing notes directly within your spreadsheet, you can provide valuable context and explanations for specific changes or decisions made during your work. The tool also automatically tracks and documents all changes made in a sheet, creating a comprehensive audit trail that includes timestamps, cell locations, previous and new values, formulas used, and the user responsible. This detailed log allows you to gain a deeper understanding of your data transformation and documentation process, facilitating knowledge transfer and collaboration among team members. Furthermore, Datum Fieldnotes promotes transparency and accountability by ensuring that every change is documented and attributed, fostering trust and confidence in the data's integrity.

Key features of Datum Fieldnotes include intuitive note-taking with timestamps and user information, a comprehensive change log with color-coded entries, a user-friendly sidebar for easy access to notes and edit history, customizable user preferences for logging activity, and visual highlighting of edited cells. The tool also generates a structured "Datasheet" with predefined questions to guide dataset documentation and tracks unique users who have contributed to the spreadsheet.

The code for Datum Fieldnotes is organized into two main files: code.gs and page.html. The code.gs file handles backend functionality such as interactions with the Google Sheets API, data logging, history tracking, and user preferences.
